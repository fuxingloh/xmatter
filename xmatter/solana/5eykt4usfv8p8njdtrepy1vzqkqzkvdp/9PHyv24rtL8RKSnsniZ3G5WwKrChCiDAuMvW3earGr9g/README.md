GUESSIT is an exciting, community-driven game where players buy credits to guess a numeric code. The goal? Crack the safe and win the ever-growing prize pool! Every attempt grows the pot and raises the stakes. But there’s more: an interactive AI Agent guards the safe, securely generates the code, and helps players strategize without revealing the solution. This isn't just a game—it’s a social phenomenon where players come together to share tips, analyze guesses, and compete for glory.
