HEEHEE is a memecoin launched on the Solana blockchain, built around community engagement and represented by its fox mascot, “Woodford,” who is the face of HEEHEE’s animations and meme content. More than a token, HEEHEE aims to be a welcoming, safe space for everyone in the crypto community, particularly those impacted by scams or rug pulls.
