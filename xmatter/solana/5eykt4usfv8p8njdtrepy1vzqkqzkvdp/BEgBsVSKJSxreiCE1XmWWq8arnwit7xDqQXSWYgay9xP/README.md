On May 1, 2019, the Woman Yelling at Cat meme was born when Twitter user @MISSINGEGIRL paired together two images. The image on the left was taken from the ;Malibu Beach Party from Hell' episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, featuring Taylor Armstrong yelling and being held back by Kyle Richards.
