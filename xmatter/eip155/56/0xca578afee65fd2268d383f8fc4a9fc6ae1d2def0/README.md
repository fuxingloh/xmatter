Fairmoon’s native BEP-20 token $FAIR is a hybrid utility token. It is both a community-owned deflationary frictionless yield token and a launchpad platform token for participating in IDO launch tiers. Passive income and liquidity generation are built into the smart contract to allow token holders to effortlessly gain more tokens automatically.
