MIX is a platform token, representing the platform's growth of value. The total amount of MIX is constant at 10 billion and will never be over-issued. A substantial amount of MIX is generated through community PoA (Proof of Action). The actions that are counted as ecosystem-friendly, such as marketing, contributing applications, creating content, providing services, are rewarded with MIX.
