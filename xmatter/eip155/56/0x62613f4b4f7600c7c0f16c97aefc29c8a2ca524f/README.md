Global Adversity Project (GAP) is a yield-generating charitable cryptocurrency that runs on the Binance Smart Network. It rewards holders by providing them ‘interest’ on their investment through the contract transaction tax, offering an incentive for investors to hold, rather then participating in day-trading events. It's charitable ventures support individuals who have mental, physical or intellectual disabilities.
