SAFECITY is a fully decentralized, deflationary, and community driven. Every time SAFECITY is sold, the smart contract automatically redistributes 8% of the transaction into four different buckets. 2% of the transaction is burned, 2% added to SAFECITY/BNB liquidity, 2% donated to charity, and 2% evenly distributed amongst every existing SAFECITY holding wallet.
