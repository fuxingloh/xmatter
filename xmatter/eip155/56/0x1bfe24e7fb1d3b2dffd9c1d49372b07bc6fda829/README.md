Launched on May 20th, ColdKoala Coin strives to make a difference in the world by dedicating a large portion of its funds to supporting charities that work with endangered and injured koalas, such as those that were displaced during the Australian Wildfires. A charity wallet has been established with 10% of the token's minted supply and through the tokenomics that have been coded into the contract, that wallet will continue to grow with every transaction.
