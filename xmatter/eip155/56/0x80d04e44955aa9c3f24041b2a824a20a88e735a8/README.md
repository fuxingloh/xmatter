Multiverse Capital is a multichain farming deflation token. 10% of each buy goes to existing holders. 10% of each sell goes into treasury fund to be used for multi-chain farming & big marketing. Investors buy $MVC on BSC, MVC farm on multiple chains and return the profits to $MVC holders. $MVC is deflationary & has price floor supported by Buyback & Burn to Liquidity Fund.
