JIND is the token that will be used by JINDO SWAP and JINDO NFT in the future. JINDO SWAP is a SWAP built on the BSC chain, and if it provides liquidity, you can receive JINDO FEED tokens. In the future these will be used on the JINDO NFT to purchase and synthesize puppies, and JINDO FEED tokens to level up puppies.
