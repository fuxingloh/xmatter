ForeverFOMO is a price-elastic token with adjusting supply, moving towards the price of $1,500.000 per token. Different then just a normal pegged token/stable coin, rebases make price-elastic tokens into synthetic commodities with fluctuating values and supplies that gradually stabilize. Ultimately, rebases are designed to be tradable and potentially extremely profitable. On the path to $1.5m a token, ForeverFOMO will release NFTs, DAPPs, and more!
