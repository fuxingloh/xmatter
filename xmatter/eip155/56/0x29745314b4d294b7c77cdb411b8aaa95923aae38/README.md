There will be two protocols of Palmswap. The intention behind both protocols is to meet the needs of average and institutional-grade traders. We offer 100% on-chain perpetuals on v1 with a VAMM model and soon a hybrid infrastructure with order book on v2 to ensure optimal slippage, liquidity, and high-speed settlement of trades for traders.
