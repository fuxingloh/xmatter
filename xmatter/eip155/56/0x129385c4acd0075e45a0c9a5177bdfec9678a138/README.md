Metakings is an AI-powered fighting universe in which anyone can earn rewards such as tokens and NFTs through competent gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. Players can engage in combat, gather resources, develop their characters, and establish their own land-based kingdoms. The game will be powered by its official token, the Metakings token ($MTK). In-game characters can also be collected as NFTs in the game and exchanged for tokens in our official NFT marketplace.
