Haber-Stornetta Token is the smallest non-divisible unit of value on the beacon chain of the Jax.Network blockchain. Since the asset token by Jax.Network called WJXN has no decimals, HST is required in order to deal with smaller units of WJXN for DeFi purposes. 1 WJXN = 10^8 HST. This unit has been named after the inventors of blockchain technology - namely Dr. Stuart Haber and Dr. Scott Stornetta - the inventors of blockchain technology who introduced the concept of digital timestamping back in 1991. They have been referenced 3 times in the Bitcoin white paper.
