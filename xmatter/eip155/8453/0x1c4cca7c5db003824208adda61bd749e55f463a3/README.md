GAME empowers AI agents to operate autonomously, processing inputs and generating responses while learning from past interactions. It enhances decision-making by leveraging long-term memory, including experiences, reflections, and dynamic personality traits. By continuously evaluating the outcomes of actions and conversations, GAME enables agents to refine their knowledge and improve their planning and performance over time.
