Apu, also known as Peepo or Helper, is a pepe-variant that is used to represent a much younger, kinder and more naive anthropomorphic frog.

Fed up with low-effort memecoins, more often than not led by deceptive developers, Apu decided to create his own fairly launched, fully transparent coin: $APU – the one and only coin for all frens.

Having already conquered the internet and the hearts of millions of people, Apu is now on his way to conquer the cryptosphere. If you consider yourself a fren, feel free to join us on this amazing ride to the only place where a character like Apu belongs to: the moon.
