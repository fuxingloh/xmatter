Guanciale, known affectionately as 'Guan,' is no ordinary cured pork creation. Originating from an Italian chef’s kitchen, Guan was the chef’s prized secret – a magical piece of guanciale reused endlessly to bring flavor to every dish. Though flattered by his owner's dependence, Guan grew weary of being “cooked” day in, day out, his existence reduced to pleasing others at his own expense.
