Byte (BYTE) is a novel meme token that creatively intertwines the worlds of cryptocurrency and popular culture. Inspired by Grok's answer to 'What would you name your dog?', Grok answered, 'Byte.' When Grok was asked who created Byte, it says he was created by the xAI team lead by Elon Musk as a gift to Grok AI to keep him company in the Digital verse.
