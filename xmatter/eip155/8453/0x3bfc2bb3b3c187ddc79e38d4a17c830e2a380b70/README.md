Wrapped POKT (wPOKT) is a tokenized version of Pocket (POKT). wPOKT is backed by POKT at a 1:1 ratio via a network of validators, allowing users to transfer liquidity between the POKT and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner. Holders of wPOKT can bridge it over to the Pocket Network blockchain to stake as a node runner, validator or directly as an application/gateway to access the relay throughput that Pocket Network provides.
