Joystream is a video platform protocol; it does for video publishing what e-mail did for mail, and Bitcoin did for money. On Joystream, all profiles, videos and social interactions live on a dedicated high throughput public blockchain. A user-controlled DAO funds creators and builders, and operates the storage and content delivery infrastructure.
