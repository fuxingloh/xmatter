Aegis As a DeFi 2.0 protocol, Aegis features more diversified lending services besides over-collateralized lending, such as micro-lending and Unsecured Borrowing. Aegis uses a proprietary AI-powered credit scoring algorithm to assess users’ creditworthiness based on the data provided, and assign an “Aegis Score” to each user, which is similar to traditional risk profile assessments.
