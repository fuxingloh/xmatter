$GENRE is the Leaving Records and GenreDAO community token. $GENRE will serve as an important part of our evolving cooperative label model with the intention to activate our artist & fan community equitably. $GENRE can be utilized in a multitude of ways across our community: access to token-gated experiences, currency for purchasing NFTs, and a governance token for the GenreDAO are some of the use cases for our token as new utility opportunities continue to emerge.
