WeTrust is a collaborative saving and insurance platform. It is autonomous, frictionless, and decentralized. WeTrust utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create a full-stack financial system that leverages existing social capital and trust networks, eliminating the need of a 'trusted third party', which allows for lower fees, improved incentive structures, decentralized risks, and a greater amount of capital to reside among the participants.
