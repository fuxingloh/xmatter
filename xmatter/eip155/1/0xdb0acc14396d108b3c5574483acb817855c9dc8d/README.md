Overline is a protocol designed to foster innovation by connecting blockchain technologies with liquidity and interoperability. Overline is built on top of a unique proof-of-work algorithm called “Proof-of-Distance” and uses mining hash power from it’s network to build a "blockchain of blockchains”, or multichain, by weaving together the states of all connected blockchain networks and recording this information into a single immutable ledger.
