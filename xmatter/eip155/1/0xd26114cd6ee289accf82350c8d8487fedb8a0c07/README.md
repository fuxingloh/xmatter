OMG Network, formerly known as OmiseGO, is a non-custodial, layer-2 scaling solution built for the Ethereum blockchain. As an Ethereum scaling solution, OMG Network is designed to allow users to transfer ETH and ERC-20 tokens significantly faster and cheaper than when transacting directly on the Ethereum network.
