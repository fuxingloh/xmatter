stkAAVE is AAVE that is staked in the Aave Protocol Safety Module. In case of a shortfall event, up to 30% of the stkAAVE can be slashed to cover the deficit. stkAAVE holders earn Safety Incentives as a reward for protecting the protocol. stkAAVE holders can also vote on governance proposals for protocol updates.
