The Bridge Ethereum Deserves! Across is a cross-chain token bridge that is secured by UMA's optimistic oracle. It is optimized for capital efficiency with a single liquidity pool, a competitive relayer landscape, and a no-slippage fee model. Across is able to process cross-chain transfers quickly because its oracle verifies transfers optimistically.
