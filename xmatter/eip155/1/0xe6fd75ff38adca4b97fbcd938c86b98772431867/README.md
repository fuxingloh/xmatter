Elastos is not an entity – it’s a global movement to build an internet that works for everyone. Starting with open source, decentralized web services, developers can build applications where all data is exchanged peer-to-peer, stored in a decentralized fashion, and secured by its owners via verifiable blockchain immutability and smart contract execution. This is an Internet of Value – with Values.
