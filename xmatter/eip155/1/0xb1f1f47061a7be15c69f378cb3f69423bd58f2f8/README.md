The Flashstake protocol is a novel financial infrastructure that allows users to receive instant yield on deposited assets by locking up principal for a chosen duration. The protocol is made possible by Flash Strategies, which utilize underlying protocols such as AAVE, Yearn, etc. to generate yield.
