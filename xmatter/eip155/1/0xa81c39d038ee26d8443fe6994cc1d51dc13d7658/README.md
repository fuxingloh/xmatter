WELCOME PEOPLE OF MOSES, GOD SENT MOSES BACK TO EGYPT TO DEMAND THE RELEASE OF THE ISRAELITES FROM SLAVERY. ​MOSES WAS BORN IN A TIME WHEN HIS PEOPLE, THE ISRAELITES, AN ENSLAVED MINORITY, WERE INCREASING IN POPULATION AND, AS A RESULT, THE EGYPTIAN PHARAOH WORRIED THAT THEY MIGHT ALLY THEMSELVES WITH EGYPT'S ENEMIES.
